## Project 1: Edmonds School District Data Analysis
- **Objective**: Analyze the satisfaction of communication regarding academic matters.
- **Tools Used**: Tableau, Excel
- **Key Insights**: Majority of of parents are satisfied with communication regarding academics. Schools with the highest percentage within school that were satisfied had 10 elementary schools in the top 13. The top three schools that aren't satisfied with communication for academics were high schools. Respondents who were monolingual (only spoke Spanish, Vietnamese, Korean, Arabic, or Russian) were less satisfied with the communication compared to respondents who spoke one of the languages above AND English. Respondents who find report cards helpful are satisfied with communication for academics. Report cards are a way for the school to communicate with respondents about their student's grades. Respondents who found conferences helpful, were satisfied with communication for academics as well. Conferences are a way for teachers to update respondents on how their studnet is doing and a direct way to communicate to the respondent. Respondents who are most satisifed with communication are  communicated with 1-2 times per year. Looking at schools that are NEVER contacted and are NOT satisfied with communication, elementary school has the lowest percentage with 0.8867% and while high school had the highest percentage with 10.084%. To conclude, high schools (Scriber Lake High School is an outlier) overall need to improve on their communication with respondents for academics, while elementary schools have overall done a good job of satisfiying respondents.
